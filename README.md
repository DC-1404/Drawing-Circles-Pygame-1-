# Pygame1
My first Pygame project. It has some different colored circles based on the key that the user presses. Movement creates a white trail, clicking the mouse creates very large circles, and clicking alphanumeric characters has a specific color for that press and release.

Made some different partial functions for drawing the circles because it would be more easily reusable. Also did a quick partial for the render() since all of them are based on the same font.

The program is fullscreen so the escape is used to exit. F fills the screen with black so the drawings are not obscured by the text displayed on screen. Can just do Enter/Return to bring them back and erase what was drawn.
